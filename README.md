# Firetail Go Library

Want to use Firetail in your project? Good news! Soon, you'll be able to find packages containing middleware for various different frameworks in the [middlewares](./middlewares) directory, and examples of their use in [examples](./examples). :)



## Tests

Automated testing is setup with the `testing` package, using [github.com/stretchr/testify](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/stretchr/testify) for shorthand assertions. You can run them with `go test`.
