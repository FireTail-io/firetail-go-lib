# Minimal Chi Example

This example Chi app is a copy of the [hello world example](https://github.com/go-chi/chi/tree/master/_examples/hello-world) from the [go-chi/chi repo](https://github.com/go-chi/chi), which has been modified to use Firetail middleware and conform to the included [app-spec.yaml](./app-spec.yaml).



## Development Environment

[Install Golang](https://go.dev/doc/install), clone the repo, build the web server & run it:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:FireTail-io/firetail-go-lib.git
cd firetail-go-lib/examples/minimal-chi
go build
./minimal-chi
```

Curl it!

```bash
curl localhost:3333/health
```

You should get the following response:

```
I'm Healthy! :)
```

And the logs should (currently) look like this:

```
